# DeveloPets 🐾 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vspedr/developets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vspedr/developets)

Introduce your animal buddies to your fellow developers! Meet new pets [here](http://vspedr.github.io/developets)!

You can add your own pets in [`/db.json`](https://github.com/vspedr/developets/blob/master/db.json) to get started!

You can use the following format to add your pet

```json
{
  "pets": [
    //...
    {
      "id": "", // generate a guid however you like
      "name": "",
      "owner": "",
      "type": "",
      "description": "",
      "img": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

> 💡 You can use an [online tool](https://www.guidgenerator.com/) to assist in generating a GUID
